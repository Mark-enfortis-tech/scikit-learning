# Scikit-learn Learning Projects

This repository contains my hands-on learning projects based on the [scikit-learn user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html).  
Each project corresponds to a section or sub-section of the guide, organized to help me (and others) explore supervised learning, unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and more.
